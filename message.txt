Good afternoon from the PRC. I wanted to let you know that a friend of mine named Jack Liao, the CEO of LightningASIC, is an admirer of your work on zogminer(1). He appreciates that you made the program open-source, and is interested in donating in support of its continued development. That is not to mention, he wishes that you may consider employment at LightningASIC, the leading manufacturer of ASIC miners for cryptocurrencies. Thanks for your consideration.
